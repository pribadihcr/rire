## Replicate Image Random Erasing (RIRE)

RIRE is a conceptually simple and general framework for domain generalization for person re-id, in which a new data augmentation scheme, called replicate image random erasing, is invoked to effectively produce discriminative features from
crowd movements and occluded image persons.


## Marathon Re-ID (MRID) Dataset
We also have collected a large number of marathon images equipped with the text cues information to provide a reliable benchmark for person re-id. This dataset has more challenging issues, such as crowded movement, occlusion, person with similar attributes, and inter- and intra class variation.

## Notes

We still partially upload the source codes and datasets and will release whole the contents later.

## Citing Detectron2
Currently, we are submitting RIRE into IEEE Signal Processing Letter and still under reviewed. Hence, if you use RIRE in your research, please use the following BibTeX entry. Later, we will update the bibtex based on the decision of SPL.

```BibTeX
